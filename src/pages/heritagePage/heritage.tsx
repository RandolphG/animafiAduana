                  The Aduana people believe that their ancestors originally came
                  from Asumanya. They also believe that they were led there by a
                  duiker, a deer like animal, that had flames coming out of the
                  mouth. They settled in Dormaa where they believe the flame is
                  still alight.

            The first queen mother of of Obo Kwahu in 1675 was called Animafi.
            She was a co-founder of Obo and it was the reason why Obo royal
            stools, the OKOMENG and ADARKWA, rotate among three different royal
            houses. These royal houses are Animafi Aduana royal house, Gyemfa
            Kyeade royal house and Afari Obuagyan/Ofosua Kobour Aduana royal
            house.
